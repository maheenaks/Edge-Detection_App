This is an interactive web-based application developed using Python, OpenCV, and Streamlit.  
It allows users to experiment with different edge detection algorithms like:
-> Canny Edge Detector
->SobelEdge Dtector 
->Laplacian Edge Detector

Users can:
- Upload an image (JPG, PNG, or BMP)
- Choose the edge detection method
- Adjust parameters using sliders
- Instantly visualize how changes affect the output



 Tools and Libraries (REQUIRMENTS)
-> Python 3
-> Streamlit
-> OpenCV
-> NumPy
-> Matplotlib


The interface is designed with a modern UI theme and provides:
-> A side-by-side view of the original and processed image  
-> Real-time parameter control using sliders and checkboxes  
-> Download option to save the processed edge-detected image (Additional feature)
